# Sharing Security Incident Knowledge in Cyber-Physical Systems

We provide the implementation of our two techniques: incident pattern extraction and instantiation. 
We also provide examples that can be used to demonstrate both techniques.

-Incident pattern extraction technique
The technique aims at generating an incident pattern from an incident instance that occurred in a specific cyber-physical system, in particular, smart buildings.

The implementation can be found under the package: ie.lero.spare.pattern_extraction

To demonstrate the technique, you can download the executable jar for the project and execute the provided example (executable_jar/scenario1_extraction). Alternatively, you can download the project and build it then execute the example.

to execute the technique: 
>>java -jar techniques.jar 

>>1 (type 1 to execute the technique)

-Incident pattern instantiation technique
The technique aims at identfiying all traces (i.e. sequences of actions) in a system that satisfy a given incident pattern.

The implementation can be found under the package: ie.lero.spare.pattern_instantiation

To demonstrate the technique, you can download the executable jar for the project and execute the provided example (executable_jar/scenario1_instantiation). Alternatively, you can download the project and build it then execute the example .

 
to execute the technique: 
>>java -jar techniques.jar 

>>2 (type 2 to execute the technique)
